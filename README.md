## Interactive Project Description

The project I have been developing is a mechanics prototype for an RPG combat system. The player takes control of multiple characters, and is intended to defeat enemies presented to them. The combat follows a turn-based system, where character/enemy/etc. involved are represented by general 'combat units'. Each turn, a given combat unit is able to issue one type of 'combat action' that they have access to, such as an attack, and then it plays out, and the turn order continues forward.
